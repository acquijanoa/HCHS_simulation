Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /usr/bin/bash
Provided cores: 1 (use --cores to define parallelism)
Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:
	count	jobs
	1	test

rule test:
    input: v3/sasdata/betas_pop_genmod_exch.sas7bdat
    output: output.sas7bdat

Error in rule test:
    jobid: 0
    output: output.sas7bdat
    shell:
        sas test.sas -sysparm v3/sasdata/betas_pop_genmod_exch.sas7bdat*output.sas7bdat
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job test since they might be corrupted:
output.sas7bdat
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
